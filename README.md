# Archived Write Ups - `archivedHtbWriteUps/`
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

Older write ups written in markdown have been stored here.
In the future, they will all be stored under `docs/` so they can be displayed on the main site.

# GlitchTech - `docs/`

This is an attempt at merging older and newer write ups into [GitHub Pages](https://clutchreboot.github.io/GlitchTech/).
The purpose of this repo is to centralize any write ups, scripts, and Metasploit modules that I have created for cyber security.
Another purpose is to keep track of commonly used tools and examples of their usage.

# Metasploit Modules - `msf-modules/`
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

These are modules created to get a foot hold on CTFs like Hackthebox.
They're located in the `msf-modules/` in this repo.

Typically, a module can be stored in the `.msf4` directory in a user's home directory.
An exmple would be `~/.msf4/modules/exploits/unix/http`.
For more information, check out [Metasploit's docs](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/using-metasploit/intermediate/running-private-modules.html#create-the-module).

# Scripts - `scripts/`

Automations that gain footholds on CTF targets are stored here.
